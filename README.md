FullStack Course Registration System.

I used Java programming , Spring Boot Framework , REST API and MySQL Database for this project.

How it Works:
-The website has 3 Components 
 1.Register a Course
 2.Course Availability
 3.Enrolled Students

1.Register a Course:
 This component was used to register for the course in a form format.

2.Course Availability:
 Here, In this component we can check the available courses in the site.

3.Enrolled Students:
 In this component, we can see the Students who were enrolled for their respective courses.

Overall Working:
 After the Successful registration , course details and materials would be send to the students respective email Id manually.

 FullStack Course Registration System
Developed a full-stack web application using Java, Spring Boot, REST API, and MySQL with an online Railway DB for database management, running on an embedded Tomcat server. 
The system includes three main components: Register a Course (students register via a form), Course Availability (view available courses), and Enrolled Students (view enrolled students per course).
Upon successful registration, course details and materials are sent to studentsâ€™ email addresses manually.
